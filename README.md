Project for Game Technology

For my juicy breakout, admittingly I didn't do anything much special. However, I thought it would be fun just to let the player be able to produce multiple balls and manage to have a bunch of them bouncing throughout the screen at once. The one thing is that the amount of balls that can be produced by clicking the mouse seems to be capped at random. Or rather, some underlying causes will have one game letting the player make more balls than in another game. It may have to do with mouse movement, but regardless, everything else about the game works pretty well.
